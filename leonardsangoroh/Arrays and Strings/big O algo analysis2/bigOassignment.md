Countdown.
The countdown method has a lineat time complexity O(n)

Countdown recursive
The main difference between countdown function and countdown recursive function is 
the method of implementation.
Loops (implemented in countdown function) occupies lesser memory compare to recursion (implemented in the countdown recursive function). This is because recursion involves pushing into a stack, jumping, returning, and popping from
stack while iteration just involves array traversal

Palindrome
The palindrome function has a linear time complexity O(n)

Palindrome using reversed string

Palindrome using recursion

Bonus question
-I would implement the palidrome function using the is_palindrome_rev since 
it does not take as much of space complexity compared to the recursion implementation.
In my perspective, it also has the lowest time complexity.

Concatinating arrays
The function has a linear time complexity O(n)

Rotate an array to the left by a certain ammount
The function has a quadratic time complexity O(n^2)

How many times a number has to be divided by two to get one as the answer
The function has logarithmic time O(log n)
