1.Countdown
def countdown(n): #this is the function that will call itself n times time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n) because it will call itself n times
    while n > 0: # while loop to count down from n to 0 time complexity of this is O(n) and space complexity is O(1) becasue it will only run once
        print(n)# print n time complexity of this is O(1) and space complexity is O(1) because it will only run once
        n -= 1 #does the same thing as n = n - 1 time complexity of this is O(1) and space complexity is O(1) becasue it will only run once
    print("Blast off!") # print blast off time complexity of this is O(1) and space complexity is O(1) because it will only run once
    #time complexity of this is O(n) reason the loop is executed n times and the print is executed n times so the total time complexity is O(n) and take the worst case scenario where n is the largest number in the list
    # space complexity is O(1) because we are not creating any new variables so the space complexity is O(1)

  2. Countdown recursive

                            #time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n) reason for this is because the function will call itself n times
    if n == 0:#the if statement will run if the number is 0 time complexity is O(1) and space complexity is O(1) because it will only run once
        print("Blast off")#print blast off time complexity is O(1) and space complexity is O(1) because it will only run once 
    else:

        countdown_recursive(n - 1)#the function will call itself n-1 times time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n) because it will call itself n-1 times 
        #overall space complexity is O(n) because it will create a new variable n-1 times and the print is executed n times so the total space complexity is O(n)
        #overall time complexity is O(n) because it will call itself n-1 times and the print is executed n times so the total time complexity is O(n)
